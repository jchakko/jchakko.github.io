  <h2>What is Lexical Diversity?</h2>
  <h3>Lexical Diversity is the ratio between unique words and total number of words in a passage. This will yield a value between 0 and 1. The closer the value is to 1, the more diverse the passage is.</h3>
  
  <h2>Highs and Lows</h2>
  <h3>It's easy to achieve a high lexical diversity score when the passage analyzed is short. I think a mark of good writing is that most sentences score 1 on the lexical diversity score. That means there are no words that appear more than once in the same sentence. In contrast the sentence I think might just have the lowest lexical diversity score is the famous "Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo".</h3> 
  
  <h3>Maintaining full lexical diversity in longer passages is quite the challenge. Additionally, calculating the value for a long work would be quite tedious. Luckily we can use Python and the NLTK to help us.</h3>
  
  <h2>Computing Lexical Diversity</h2>
  <h3>There's only two values we need to calculate the lexical diversity: the number of unique words and the total number of words. After tokenizing the text to be analyzed, extracting these values is quite simple.</h3>
  <h3>The number of unique words = len(set(tokens)). This works because sets do not contain duplicate values. The total number of words = len(tokens). Divide those two values and there you have it.</h3>
