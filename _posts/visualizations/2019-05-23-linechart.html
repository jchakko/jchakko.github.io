    <h3>Line charts are a tried and true method of visualizing data that has been around for centuries. It is best suited for showing how a dependent variable changes over time. The most basic line chart requires a path that intersects with all of the data points. The data points themselves can also be marked with an icon which helps readability. When using D3 the path is only one element. Marking the datapoints can provide more mouseover interaction opportunities and increased data density.</h3>
           
    <h3>This visualization combines data from two sources. Counts from the <a href="https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/data/">United States Wind Turbine Database</a> and energy production from <a href="https://windexchange.energy.gov/maps-data/321">WINDExchange</a> . The line plots the total wind energy produced each year. The circles are colored to create groupings based on production per wind turbine. Additionally, Mousing over a circle reveals a tooltip that shows the average turbine production.</h3>
    
    <h3>The progression of circle colors shows that turbines are becoming more efficient. This is important since land is a commodity. Hopefully there will be more breakthroughs in turbine efficiency that push the average even higher.</h3>
