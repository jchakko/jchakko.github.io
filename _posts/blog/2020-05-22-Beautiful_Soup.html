<h2>Let's have a go at it</h2>

<p>There is so much data available on the internet. I'm sure you already know that. The results of any modern sports tournament are hosted somewhere. Countless blog posts and movie reviews are available to the public free of charge. Often, the questions that I want answered need a dataset that hasn't been built yet. No problem. I've seen what a dataset looks like, I can certainly build one myself.</p>

<p>BeautifulSoup is a Python library that makes it a snap to request HTML pages and parse the information on them. With a few short loops web pages are transformed into a luxurious CSV or JSON file.</p>
