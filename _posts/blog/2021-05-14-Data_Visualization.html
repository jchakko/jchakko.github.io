<h2>History of Data Viz</h2>

<p>Communication with images. John W. Tukey. Its easier to understand concepts with images. Blueprints and Seismographs are data visualizations. Find patterns and develop hypothesis using the images. Communicate the results to others. Minard's Map of Napoleon's Diastrous RUssia 1812. Sankey diagram. John Snows 1854 Cholera Outbreak helped prove its water borne. Nightingale's Rose chart showed more soldiers died of disease.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<p>Is and Art and a Science. Data layer, mapping layer, graphic layer. Typical datasets have rows, and columns with variables. Nominal, ordinal, and quantitative variables.</p>

<h2>Color</h2>
<p>Hues, primary colors secondary colors. Saturation is purity of color.</p>

<h2>Interaction Effects</h2>
<p>Pointing with mouse. Touch. Region selection. Magic Lens. Zoom for better look. Filter to view subset. Extra detail on click.</p>

<h2>Charts</h2>     
<p>Line chart changes over time. Bar chart compares categories. Radial: cool but misleading. Pareto descending bars with a line to show defects. Histogram, bins of data. Pie chart: parts of a whole. Sunburst chart shows a hierarchy. Charts can be intentionally misleading. Pie charts are the worst.</p>

<h2>Geovisualization</h2>
