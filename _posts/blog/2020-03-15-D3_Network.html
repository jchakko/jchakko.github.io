<h2>The Line Between Honor and Vengence</h2>

<p>I am prefacing this post by saying this is all from the Dungeons and Dragons campaign I am playing and not in real life. Someone blew up the side of the tavern I sleep at and killed about a dozen people in the process. I had my doubts that the city's law enforcement would be able to handle this case so I took it into my own hands.</p>
