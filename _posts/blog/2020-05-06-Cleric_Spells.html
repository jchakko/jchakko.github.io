<h2>The Art of Not Taking Notes</h2>

<p>Clerics are awesome. They can fill many roles and playstyles from backline to the front. I had trouble finding my footing when I first started playing because I had some misconceptions about what a cleric should do. While clerics have the ability to heal it isn't a good use of tempo. On one turn I can heal about 8 HP which isn't helpful when my paladin is getting hit for 26 damage. Once I realized what the better spells are I realized how powerful clerics truly are.</p>

<h2>Cantrips</h2>
<p>Cantrips can be cast an unlimited number of times. They can't be changed so its very easy to get stuck with a bunch of bad ones. Even if thats the situation you're stuck in, eventually you'll get a 4th one and you can pick up Guidance. It's too powerful to pass up. Guidance lets people roll a d4 when doing an ability check. A lot of things require ability checks like jumping chasms, lockpicking, persuasion. I spam guidance out of combat because.</p>

<p>I like the idea of Thaumaturgy but it rarely sees use. My DM Ricardo runs a flavorful campaign and I always look for opportunities to act a fool and even then its hard to find usage for it. Spare the Dying is outclassed by a level 1 spell called Healing Word. The last cantrip I have is Sacred Flame which is basically a normal hit.</p>

<h2>Proactive over Reaction</h2>

<h4>Like I said earlier, healing damage that has already been dealt is not a good use of time. Its better to prevent the damage from happening in the first place. This makes Bless a very powerful cleric spell. It grants 3 creatures an extra d4 dice on attack rolls and saving throws. Simply put it makes the party more accurate when attacking and more likely to avoid harmful effects. This spell stands head and shoulder over the other level one options for a few reasons. It works on 3 players, it doesn't have some prerequesite for the d4 to be rolled, and it does not disappear when the target attacks. Bless is powerful that I built my strategy around this spell.</h4>
