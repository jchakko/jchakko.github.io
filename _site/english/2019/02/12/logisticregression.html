  <h2>What is Logistic Regression?</h2>
  <h3>Logistic Regression is a classification technique that outputs a probability that an instance belongs to a class based on an observation or multiple observations. For example, the probability that its summer based on the number of cricket chirps.</h3>
  
  <h2>The Math</h2>
  <h3>The Logistic Regression model probability can be represented by the equation 1/(1+e^-(a + bX)). The variable a represents the intercept coefficient. It will yield the probability of Summer when there are no chirps. The variable b is the observation coefficient. It is how much we believe that the observation contributes to the outcome. Finally X is amount of the observation.</h3>
  
  <h2>The Significance</h2>
  <h3>Logistic Regression provides a relative quick and easy way to classify data. It can handle both quantitative and categorical predictors.</h3>

  <h3>Gradient Descent is a technique used to calculate the best estimate for this model.</h3>
