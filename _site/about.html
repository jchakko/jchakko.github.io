  <h1>Hey hows it going? This is a website I created to organize my thoughts and experiments. It started with posts about natural language processing, then it was expanded to my host my code samples and soon after I realized it was best if I stored anything I need quick access to so you can also find my recipe for buffalo wings here. Thank you for stopping by =].</h1>
