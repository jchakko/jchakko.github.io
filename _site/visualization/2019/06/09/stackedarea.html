    <h3>I'm a big fan of Super Smash Brothers Melee and have played it basically since it came out. I've entered a few tournaments and learned that despite all these years I am not good at the game. At the highest level of play very few players excel. Even after 15 years of competition, less than 20 players have won a major tournament. This data can be found on <a href="https://liquipedia.net/smash/Major_Tournaments/Melee">Liquipedia</a></h3>
    
    <h3>Stacked Area charts show how different values change over time. Its basically a bunch of multi line chart but the series are stacked on top of each other. This leads to some unique quirks. First, its easy to tell the summed value of all the series. However it isn't feasible to determine the value of an individual series.</h3>
    
    <h3>I decided to create a stacked area chart using each player that has won a major tournament as a series. It definitely pushed the limit of how many unique, meaningful colors I could put into the chart. I thought about reducing the group by only considering players who have won more than one tournament. However, its such an accomplishment that I did not want to leave anyone out. There were some interesting takeaways from seeing this data in a visual format. First is how some players had droughts lasting years in between wins. Second was seeing when each player left a mark on the game's history.</h3>
