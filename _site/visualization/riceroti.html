  <h3>Carb choice is serious business in India. I colored in this map to understand which states eat rice and which eat roti. The results were not too surprising, basically the north west are the biggest consumers of wheat. There were a few neutral states in the center. Most of the states ate a combination, even if it was unbalanced. States in the north west were very polarized. This may caused by their physical and cultural connection to other Asian countries.</h3>
