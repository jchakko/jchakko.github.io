    <h3>Pictograms utilize icons to convey information. Each icon represents an equal value of data. They add more personality to the visualization and can be easier to understand. D3 has limited built in elements but custom svg art can be used. SVG icons are widely available online on websites like <a href="https://icomoon.io/">IcoMoon</a>.</h3>
           
    <h3>
    This pictogram is an alternate take on the survey results found in Berkeley Lab's
    <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/projects/wind-neighbor-survey">National Survey of Attitudes of Wind Power Project Neighbors</a>. The report contains five bargraphs that depict the spread of people's attitude towards wind projects based on the distance of their home to the nearest wind turbine. Unsurpisingly, residents are less content the closer they live to a wind energy project.</h3>
    
    <h3>Utilizing interaction effects, this information can be conveyed in a single, updating chart. All five survey distance results are included in the HTML file. At first the overall results are displayed. When the mouse is placed near text, the data will be changed to the corresponding survey results and the visualization is updated. This effect was achieved by placing invisible rectangles over the text that contain the mouseover interaction instructions.</h3>
