They can fill many roles and playstyles from backline to the front. I had trouble finding my footing when I first started playing because I had some misconceptions about what a cleric should do. While clerics have the ability to heal it isn't a good use of tempo. On one turn I can heal about 8 HP which isn't helpful when my paladin is getting hit for 26 damage. Once I realized what the better spells are I realized how powerful clerics truly are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cantrips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cantrips can be cast an unlimited number of times. They can't be changed so its very easy to get stuck with a bunch of bad ones. Even if thats the situation you're stuck in, eventually you'll get a 4th one and you can pick up Guidance. It's too powerful to pass up. Guidance lets people roll a d4 when doing an ability check. A lot of things require ability checks like jumping chasms, lockpicking, persuasion. I spam guidance out of combat because.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of Thaumaturgy but it rarely sees use. My DM Ricardo runs a flavorful campaign and I always look for opportunities to act a fool and even then its hard to find usage for it. Spare the Dying is outclassed by a level 1 spell called Healing Word. The last cantrip I have is Sacred Flame which is basically a normal hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Proaction Over Reaction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said earlier, healing damage that has already been dealt is not a good use of time. Its better to prevent the damage from happening in the first place. This makes Bless a very powerful cleric spell. It grants 3 creatures an extra d4 dice on attack rolls and saving throws. Simply put it makes the party more accurate when attacking and more likely to avoid harmful effects. This spell stands head and shoulder over the other level one options for a few reasons. It works on 3 players, it doesn't have some prerequesite for the d4 to be rolled, and it does not disappear when the target attacks. Bless is so powerful that I build my strategy around this spell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Focus Your Mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few different spell cast types. Bless is concentration. Concentration spells break when casting another concentration spell or failing a constitution save after taking damage. Since I want bless up all the time I stay strapped with non concentration spells. Some good options are Healing Word, Guiding Bolt, Inflict Wounds, Aid, and Sanctuary. Healing Word is as bonus action that can ressurect people from a distance. Guiding Bolt deals damage and makes the next hit against the same target more accurate. Inflict wounds is 3d10s of nectrotic damage and Aid gives a session long HP increase to multiple party members. Sanctuary makes an ally harder to hit which in theory can be combined with other dodge improvements to make a friend unhittable. Then there's Spiritual Weapon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Weapon is a bonus cast spell that creats a floating, movable weapon as a bonus action. It only takes one spell slot to cast then it can be used to melee attack from long range as a bonus action. It does not interfere with Bless, its empowered by it. This combined with ordinary attacking puts out some real damage. It also makes playing more fun. My party does not have a strong front line. Discovering this spell made me realize that I can stand in the front and fight. After the mace comes the spiritual mace and with Bless, both are going to hit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Life Beyond Bless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bless is not the end all be all Cleric spell. Even if it was it would get boring to cast all of the time. In future sessions I'm looking cast Silence and Spirit Guardians as soon as I get 3rd Level Spells. Silence wrecks other spellcasters because most spells have a speaking component. Spirit Guardians slows and batters enemies around the caster. There was a time when I healed as a Cleric, now I don't have the time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Clerics are awesome.

&lt;p&gt;There is so much data available on the internet. I'm sure you already know that. The results of any modern sports tournament are hosted somewhere. Countless blog posts and movie reviews are available to the public free of charge. Often, the questions that I want answered need a dataset that hasn't been built yet. No problem. I've seen what a dataset looks like, I can certainly build one myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/&quot;&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt; is a Python library that makes it a snap to request HTML pages and parse the information on them. With a few short loops web pages are transformed into a luxurious CSV or JSON file. BeautifulSoup is web scraper as opposed to a web crawler. Web crawlers can be programmed to traverse pages on their own when they encounter a link while web scrapers must be told which pages to parse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scraping a set of web pages has 2 parts: how do I extract the information on an individual page and how do I get the set of pages to parse from? It comes down to pattern recognition and using the element inspector. The user score could have its own div. The URLs of each page may only differ by a date or city name. Better yet there could be a page that contains the URL for every episode. Each situation is going to be different so let's take a look at some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collecting a list of National Parks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example I start with the individual page for Florida's National Parks. The code below requests the page html and prints the names and links of the parks. I manually found the div that contains the park information and manually chose to search for the h3 tags because thats how the page chose to display the names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
    import requests

    url = &quot;https://www.nps.gov/state/fl/index.htm&quot;
    soup = BeautifulSoup(requests.get(url).content)

    florida = soup.find(id = &quot;parkListResultsArea&quot;)
    parks = florida.find_all('h3')

    for park in parks:
        link = park.find('a')
        print(link)
  &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Line Between Honor and Vengence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am prefacing this post by saying this is all from the Dungeons and Dragons campaign I am playing and not in real life. Someone blew up the side of the tavern I sleep at and killed about a dozen people in the process. I had my doubts that the city's law enforcement would be able to handle this case so I took it into my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D3.js is a powerful data visualization library that displays graphics right in your browser. It can consume geographic information which is widely available these days. With some additional data, D3 can make compelling geovisualizations like choropleths, and dot density maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preparing the Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of spatial data that is free to use on the internet. For this post I am using the free country level data provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diva-gis.org/gdata&quot;&gt;DIVA-GIS.&lt;/a&gt; Spatial data is often separated into a few components then compressed into a zip file. D3 cannot work with the data in this format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully there are tools online that convert spatial data zip files to GeoJSON, a format that is D3 friendly. My go to is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mapshaper.org/&quot;&gt;Mapshaper&lt;/a&gt;. Import the entire zip file. Mapshaper has a simplify feature which makes the file smaller but the lines less precise. I like to play with it and pretend I'm making minimalist art or something. Anyways when you're finished export the data as a GeoJSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Display the Spatial Data&lt;/h2&gt;   

&lt;p&gt;Projections make it possible to display a 3D object on a 2D surface. There are a handful of projections each with their strengths and differences. GeoJSON coordinates can be transformed by a projection function then displayed using a line generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building the Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Network datasets create awesome visualizations. I like seeing the networks created by characters in books and TV shows. When I first started looking for datasets I found they were hard to come by. This is probably because determining what counts as a connection between characters is difficult. Mechanically the only thing to do is create a CSV file where characters that are connected appear on the same row. But to consume the media and attempt to record all the interactions between characters would be painful and probably make you dislike the show you were trying to visualize in the first place.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;I think the challenge comes from finding preexisting data that is suitable to be transformed into a network. One of the 'Hello World' networks to analyze is the Les Misérables (pronounce it like lay miz-er-ah) dataset. The principle behind the network creation is simple. If two characters appear in the same chapter, they are given an edge. This simplifies a lot because its possible for a machine to do this computation. Now, there may be connections between two characters who never interact if they happen to be in the same chapter. This is a necessary tradeoff because its too difficult to judge what counts as an interaction.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;My first idea was to create a network of Star Wars. I couldn't get my footing. The problem was there is no unified collection of Star Wars characters. Looking up characters I already know about is easy but to find characters that I don't know was too difficult. If I only used the movies as separators there would not be enough of them to draw interesting distinctions. The second idea was to do The Office. Separating by episode isn't strict enough but I did find a website that groups interactions by scene. I ended up not doing this because there weren't enough characters and the characters interact with each other far too often.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So to create a good network we need a lot of separations and a lot of characters. This led me to the anime Naruto which I watched a lot in middle school. Despite watching it a lot I didn't get very far. Thanks to the pace new episodes were broadcasted over the course of 2 years I made it to episode 70 or so and there are 500 in total. Anyways this fits the criteria because there are hundreds of characters and hundreds of separations. I easily found a listing of episodes from Narutopedia. I wrote a web scraper that visits each page and grans the characters listed in the credits. Let me not gloss over that part, the credit listing on each episode was the make or break for this project. I originally started working with the Manga which also has an webpage for each chapter but there was no simple way for me to determine which characters appeared in each chapter.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The web scraper created put the credits for each episode in a list. I then used itertools to create combinations for each list. Finally I wrote them into a csv to be loaded by Gephi. Overall the coding was not too dificult because the information was already stored in a format that could be transformed into the csv file. If I stuck with the manga I would have had to parse the chapter summaries and extract the character names.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to GIS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spatial data is becoming all the rage. There's been plenty of research done on Geographic Information System (GIS) and the data is becoming more publicly available. Cities are incresingly making their spatial data available for free to anyone who can access their websites. This data can be used by D3 to create interactive maps that are easily sharable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Preparing the Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Projections make it possible to display a 3D object on a 2D surface. There are a handful of projections each with their strengths and weaknesses. GeoJSON coordinates can be transformed by a projection function then drawn using a line generator. I created a template that can take GeoJSON data and render a map with Mercator projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a lot of work to look at a map of Switzerland but it's only the foundation. The key power behind D3 is interactivity and binding data to elements. Depending on the data I can color in regions of the map, mark the locations of major cities, and react to user mouse activity. Its very manual but allows for some truly compelling visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Art of Not Taking Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined a Call of Cthullu campaign as if I don't spend enough time role playing already. One aspect of the game I appreciate is how its based on real locations; after a quick stint in Peru and a time skip my party ends up in New York. I wanted a visual way to keep track of our progres and decided to go with marking the locations we've visited on a D3 map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making The Map&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was to find an appropriate GeoJSON of Manhattan. NYC OpenData has a lot of publicly available GIS files including the&lt;a href= &quot;https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTA-/cpf4-rkhq&quot;&gt; Neighborhood Tabulation Areas&lt;/a&gt; This draws the visualization I want but also every other borough in New York. To subset the spatial file I used &lt;a href= &quot;https://geopandas.org/&quot;&gt;GeoPandas&lt;/a&gt;. The library lets me import the spatial file as a dataframe. After a quick peek at the metadata I selected only the rows that contain Manhattan's borough code and exported the selection to a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the map is up, I need to create markings on the map to show where the team has visited. Evidently the Cthullu handbook has the intersections for each place of interest and my patient Keeper Andriy passed it along to me. Call of Cthullu is in the 1920's so some of the street names have changed. Still, when I pass the information into Google Maps it takes it like a champ and gives me the coordinate information back. I apply the projection function to the coordinates and plot the output on top of the map of Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;I jotted a few key facts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map needed some additional information to explain the relevance of the marked points. I added a mouseover effect that displays a tooltip with the name of the location, the game provided address, and quick description of what we did there. Adding points to the map gives the story a feeling of progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Choropleths and Cenus Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common forms of geographic data is census information. It can show how different parts of a region think, feel, and behave about a myriad of topics. A powerful way to convey this information is with a Choropleth. This visualization colors in sections of a map based on the data provided. I got my hands on census data from India to settle a very important question. Who's eating rice and who's eating roti?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The census had a section about the per capita rice and wheat consumption in every state of India. I extracted the data to a CSV file and found an accompanying GeoJSON file. Its important that the number of entries in both files are the same so D3 knows where to color. With some simple arithmatic and color scales I created a map thats more green when a state eats rice and more saffron when roti is the carb of choice. Mousing over a state shows the original information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What else?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Graph data is a visual medium. Since nodes do not have a fixed position in space and edges often do not have defined lengths, it's up to the artist to determine the arrangement. I like looking at social networks which would be much more compelling with the use of images to represent the characters. I couldn't find a straightforward way to add images in Gephi which is the software I use when analyzing networks. Looking up solutions in Python and R graphing libraries didn't help much either.&lt;/h3&gt;
    
&lt;h3&gt;Eventually I decided to do it manually with the help of Inkscape, a SVG editing software. After exporting the network as an SVG file, I imported the official character art for each character and placed it on top of their nodes. The images had transparency beyond the character so they do not interfere with the edge lines.&lt;/h3&gt; 

&lt;h3&gt;This process made me realize that automating the image handling isn't a good idea. One common graph visualization technique is to increase the size of nodes that have a high degree. That works well when every node is a circle. However characters have different poses and physiques. Sometimes images had dimensions 100+ pixels bigger but still looked smaller than others. In this case, the perception of images is more important than their absolute sizes.&lt;/h3&gt;
    
    
&lt;h3&gt;If you think this process sounds tedious, it was. There were many times where a weapon obscured an edge or a character cluttered the network by reaching out too far. I went back to Gephi many times to rearrange the nodes to get a new SVG export. The good news is that Inkscape preserved the sizes of each image so each time I reconstructed it was a little faster. Ultimately, this version is way cooler than text over circles.&lt;/h3&gt;
