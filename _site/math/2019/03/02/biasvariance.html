  <h2>What is Bias?</h2>
  <h3>Bias is how much the model predictions are off compared to the actual values. If the bias is low, the prediction was accurate. If the bias is high, the prediction was inaccurate.</h3>
  
  <h2>What is Variance?</h2>
  <h3>Variance is the spread of the predictions. If the variance is low, the model is making predictions that are close to each other. If the variance is high, the model is making predictions that are far apart.</h3>
  
  <h2>The Tradeoff</h2>
  <h3>The goal is to get a low bias and a low variance. That means the model is making accurate, consistent predictions. The bias can be decreased by increasing the variance. That means the model will predict more accurately if it is given more flexibility but that can be erratic. Variance can be decreased by incresing the bias. That means the model can predict more consistent values but they will be less accurate.</h3>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <h3>This concept gives insight on overfitting. A high variance may not initially seem like an issue, after all, the model is predicting accurate values. However, this makes the model overly attached to the training data. Its important to minimize both the bias and variance.</h3>
