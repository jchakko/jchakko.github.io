    <h1>3 Types of Probability</h1>
    <p>23 January 2019</p>
      <div id = "postContents"> 
  <h2>Marginal Probability: P(A)</h2>
  <h3>The probability that an event will occur. It is not conditioned by another event. That's really it.</h3>
  
  <h2>Joint Probability: P(A ∩ B)</h2>
  <h3>The probability that an event will occur AND another event will occur.</h3>
  
  <h2>Conditional Probability: P(A | B)</h2>
  <h3>The probability that an event will occur given that we already know a different event has occured. The probability that A will occur given that we've witnessed B occur is P(A ∩ B) / P(B). That's the joint probability / marginal probability of the event we already witnessed. In plain english its the probability of events A and B happening divided by the chance of B happening in general.</h3>
  
  <h2>Application</h2>
  <h3>These probabilities are the building blocks of Baye's Rule</h3>
