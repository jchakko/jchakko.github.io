<h3>Line graphs are tricky to implement in D3. Even though they are one of the oldest and most simple visualizations it took me a while to create one. Other visualizations like scatterplots and bar charts expect the data in a row format which is easily stored in a CSV file. This is an intuitive and easy to understand format for humans. My original intuition was that drawing a line plot would be as simple as telling D3 to connect the circles made in a scatterplot.</h3>
    
    
<h3>However, D3 line graphs utilize SVG paths which take an array of coordinate pairs as input. This format can not be realized in a csv format. One solution is to convert the CSV to a JSON which is capable of handling the array format. I found this conversion process tricky. Additionally, the data stored in an array format is much less interpretable for humans and I am one.</h3>

<h3>It is possible to create a multi-line plot from a CSV file using the D3 Nest function. This function takes in a dataset and organizes it by keys. In this case I passed in a dataset of aggregated cricket scores for multiple cricketers and specified that their names are the keys. Nest returns a JSON object that contains the array format for each player. Now creating the lines is a simple as passing the nested data to the line generators.</h3>
