<h2>Welcome to GIS</h2>

<p>Spatial data is becoming all the rage. There's been plenty of research done on Geographic Information System (GIS) and the data is becoming more publicly available. Cities are incresingly making their spatial data available for free to anyone who can access their websites. This data can be used by D3 to create interactive maps that are easily sharable.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Data</h2>

<p>For this post I am using the free country level data provided by <a href="https://www.diva-gis.org/gdata">DIVA-GIS.</a> Spatial data is often separated into a few components then compressed into a zip file. D3 cannot work with the data in this format. Thankfully there are tools online that convert spatial data zip files to GeoJSON, a format that is D3 friendly. My go to is <a href="https://mapshaper.org/">Mapshaper</a>. Import the entire zip file. Mapshaper has a simplify feature which makes the file smaller but the lines less precise. I like to play with it and pretend I'm making minimalist art or something. Anyways when you're finished export the data as a GeoJSON file.</p>

<h2>Display the Spatial Data</h2>   

<p>Projections make it possible to display a 3D object on a 2D surface. There are a handful of projections each with their strengths and weaknesses. GeoJSON coordinates can be transformed by a projection function then drawn using a line generator. I created a template that can take GeoJSON data and render a map with Mercator projection.</p>

<h2>The Application</h2>

<p>This seems like a lot of work to simply look at a map of Switzerland but it's only the foundation. The key power behind D3 is interactivity and binding data to elements. Depending on the data I can color in regions of the map, mark the locations of major cities, and react to user mouse activity. Its very manual but allows for some truly compelling visualizations.</p>
