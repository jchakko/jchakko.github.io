<h2>Let's have a go at it</h2>

<p>Malayalam has an elegant alphabet that cannot be confined to a single keyboard. A triple keyboard gets close but even then there are characters that are not inputtable with a single button press. When I first started typing in Malayalam I struggled to find many characters and didn't realize that a lot of them aren't on the keyboard at all. Even with the progress I've made it is still a time consuming process. I can't type with all my fingers, rather I click on characters individually.</p>

<p>I use a few websites to speed up the process. The first is GOOGLE TRANSLATE which uses a sequence to sequence model to translate betweeen English. It can be fairly reliable for finding the base version of a verb and simple phrase combinations when given an English input. The more accurate method is to provide a Malayalam input and verify that the English translate is reasonable. For that I use OLAM, an English to Malayalam dictionary.</p>

<p>There will always be an adverb or phrase combination thats too difficult for me to express to a computer. For these cases I turn to manually typing. My keyboard of choice is BRANAH MALAYALAM. I'm sure that native speakers can zip through with this but I was confused as heck the first time I used it.</p>

<p>The keyboard has 3 layers. The first layer has vowels on the top left and consonants. The second layer is accessed by clicking shift and the third is accessed by clicking control. A fourth layer can be accessed by clicking shift and control but its empty for Malayalam. This leads me to believe there are languages that have even more characters and I wish their speakers all the best.<p>

<p>Stressed consonants and vowels</p>
