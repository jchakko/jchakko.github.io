  <h3>Hey thanks for visiting my website. My name is Joseph and I am studying data analytics. I enjoy snooping for datasets and making visualizations from them. D3 is awesome because its browser based and easy to share with others. I also can't draw so its nice to be able to do something artistic for once.</h3>
  
  <h3>Natural language processing fascinates me. I've learned how to recognize patterns and analyze text sequences in English. I am working on applying this to Malayalam, a language that has a different approach to sentence construction.</h3>
